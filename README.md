# custom_ner
Use our code can easy to train a custom new model to infer.

This project is implemented based on [spacy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy). So I'm just a porter.

First you can use the test.py to ner some car brands, types and component.

For the model, we use a small amount of manual annotation.

We simply extracted a part of car brands, types and component from the wiki, manually labeled them with a small amount, and then matched them from the text to automatically create a NER dataset. This eliminates the need to use such NER annotation tools.

##Data processing
 If you have both sentences and entity words, you might as well use the **get_ner_dataset.py** to directly generate the files needed for training through matching.

You can modify your file location and other parameters in the **ner_data_config()** function in the file, and there are corresponding annotations. This is a code that supports multi-processing. If you don't have much data, you can run the following code for single-process operation.

Also you can use this code to set the parameters, but note that there must be no spaces before and after "="
```
python get_ner_dataset.py with entity_path="./dataset/entity" \                                         
class_path="./dataset/class.txt" text_type='pkl' \  
text_path="/Users/xcxhy/AIProject/dataset/ner/prodid_to_prodname_dict.pkl" \ 
save_dir="./dataset" 
```
The single-process code is running, please run the concat file
```                                    
python concat_dict.py
```
 **Attention:** This requires you to use the category you want to identify to name the file, for example, we use "brand.txt" to name the brand entity. For documents containing entity words, I have set two formats: 'pkl' or 'txt'. We recommend saving documents in txt format, and saving each sentence with a newline.

Multi-process runs the main.sh file directly, and the parameters that need to be modified should be modified in the file.
