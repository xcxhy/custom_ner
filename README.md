# custom_ner
Use our code can easy to train a custom new model to infer.

this project is implemented based on [spacy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy).So I'm just a porter.

First you can use the test.py to ner some car brands, types and component.
For the model, we use a small amount of manual annotation.

We simply extracted a part of car brands, types and component from the wiki, manually labeled them with a small amount, and then matched them from the text to automatically create a NER dataset. This eliminates the need to use such NER annotation tools.

General annotation tools likes,

 If you have both sentences and entity words, you might as well use the **get_ner_dataset.py** to directly generate the files needed for training through matching.

```
python get_ner_dataset.py
```

You can modify your file location and other parameters in the ner_data_config() function in the file, and there are corresponding annotations. This is a code that can use multi-process to speed up the operation, so nums and batch are particularly important. If your data volume Not much, you can directly set nums to 0 when using a single process, and set batch to the length of your data.
 

 **Attention:** This requires you to use the category you want to identify to name the file, for example, we use "brand.txt" to name the brand entity.
